# Welcome to my blog üåä

This is the very first post on my new personal site. The idea to start blogging first came to be a long, long time ago, but has been on the back burner for the past ~15 years. Now, 15 years later, the time has finally come to set the first step and start. Will it hold up? I don't know, but for now I'm excited to start.

## Why start a blog?

The first answer that comes to mind is "why not?", but at a deeper level there are multiple reasons:

### Getting better (and used) to writing

As just about everyone else, I dream of one day writing a book. About the events that got me to where I am today, about the things I learned and about the people I encountered and came to know.
Next to that I'm also deeply interested in the current state of the world and would like to share my thoughts about it. Things like the rise of the meme emperor Donald Trump (yes, I know the boring-electrical-space-dog-man comes to mind, but let's not call him an emperor), the changes that AI is bringing to the way we interact with not just the web, but also each other and the effects developments like these will have on our current and future society. Almost cringe (maybe it even is), I know, since every bum on the (www) streets seems to have an opinion on these topics, and online platforms are filled with people giving their 2piece without anyone asking. These opinions are mostly based on their personal experience but fail to look at the broader picture and keep other perspectives in mind. That's why, when writing about sensitive subjects, I'll try to approach them from a neutral perspective without judging what's right or what's wrong.

### State of mind

Due to some circumstances I was stressed out a lot which in turn caused me to be able to fill my days with games (WoW and CoD being the main contributors) to sedate my adhd brain, but now the stress is subsiding I find myself getting bored more quickly and thus with more time on my hands and a desire to fill my time with something more productive.

### Interesting exploration

Even though we were born to late to explore the world, and to early to explore the stars, there is still a lot to explore right here in front of our noses. What I mean is that there are so many things to learn about the world, the people in it and the things we do, that I feel like I can spend my entire life learning new things and still not know everything. This blog will be a way for me to share my findings with the world, and hopefully get some feedback on them as well.

## Some side notes

Since AI is on the rise it is tempting to use it to write this blog, but that wouldn't help me write better and also add to the already abundant amount of AI generated SLOB. I think there will be a period in the future where real skills will get more valuable as they start getting more rare although in the long term this will balance itself out again. Or maybe our idea of what skills are valuable will change, guess we'll see.

So bear with me. Practice makes perfect, so expect improvement over time.
