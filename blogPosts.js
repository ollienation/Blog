    "content": "# Welcome to my blog 🌊\n\nThis is the very first post on my new personal site. The idea to start blogging first came to be a long, long time ago, but has been on the back burner for the past ~15 years. Now, 15 years later, the time has finally come to set the first step and start. Will it hold up? I don't know, but for now I'm excited to start.\n\n## Why start a blog?\n\nThe first answer that comes to mind is \"why not?\", but at a deeper level there are multiple reasons:\n\n### Getting better (and used) to writing\n\nAs just about everyone else, I dream of one day writing a book. About the events that got me to where I am today, about the things I learned and about the people I encountered and came to know.\nNext to that I'm also deeply interested in the current state of the world and would like to share my thoughts about it. Things like the rise of the meme emperor Donald Trump (yes, I know the boring-electrical-space-dog-man comes to mind, but let's not call him an emperor), the changes that AI is bringing to the way we interact with not just the web, but also each other and the effects developments like these will have on our current and future society. Almost cringe (maybe it even is), I know, since every bum on the (www) streets seems to have an opinion on these topics, and online platforms are filled with people giving their 2piece without anyone asking. These opinions are mostly based on their personal experience but fail to look at the broader picture and keep other perspectives in mind. That's why, when writing about sensitive subjects, I'll try to approach them from a neutral perspective without judging what's right or what's wrong.\n\n### State of mind\n\nDue to some circumstances I was stressed out a lot which in turn caused me to be able to fill my days with games (WoW and CoD being the main contributors) to sedate my adhd brain, but now the stress is subsiding I find myself getting bored more quickly and thus with more time on my hands and a desire to fill my time with something more productive.\n\n### Interesting exploration\n\nEven though we were born to late to explore the world, and to early to explore the stars, there is still a lot to explore right here in front of our noses. What I mean is that there are so many things to learn about the world, the people in it and the things we do, that I feel like I can spend my entire life learning new things and still not know everything. This blog will be a way for me to share my findings with the world, and hopefully get some feedback on them as well.\n\n## Some side notes\n\nSince AI is on the rise it is tempting to use it to write this blog, but that wouldn't help me write better and also add to the already abundant amount of AI generated content(read slob). I think there will be a period in the future where real skills will get more valuable as they start getting more rare although in the long term this will balance itself out again. Or maybe our idea of what skills are valuable will change, guess we'll see.\n\nSo bear with me. Practice makes perfect, so expect improvement over time.\n\n## 🧑‍💻Techstack\n\nA blog about tech wouldn't be complete without a techstack. Since I'm chronically low on funds it's old, but it does the job.\n\nPC\n\n- CPU: AMD Threadripper 1950X\n- GPU: RTX 2080\n- Motherboard: Asrock Phantom Gaming X399\n- Storage: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 500GB\n- Storage: Sandisk 1TB\n- Mem: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-3000\n- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS + windows 10 (dual boot)\n\nLaptop\n\n- Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen\n- CPU: I9-9880H\n- GPU: Quadro T2000\n- Mem: 32GB DDR4-2666\n- Storage: 512GB NVMe SSD\n- OS: Arch Linux\n\nWeb services\n\n- AWS EC2 free tier\n- AWS S3 free tier\n- AWS amplify free tier\n- Vast.ai - BIS for gpu rental\n\nMain software\n\n- Terminal: Kitty + tmux\n- IDE: Neovim + LazyVim\n\n- Browser: Firefox\n\nMain AI's\n\n- Assistant AI: gemini Flash 2.5\n- Search/information AI's: Perplexity with claude sonnet 4 + grok 4\n- Coding AI: OpenAI o3 (this is meh because of the outdated training data, but writes good code)\n",

    "content": "\n# Getting Started with Dynamic Markdown Blogs\n\nThis is a sample blog post demonstrating the new dynamic markdown system. The frontmatter above contains all the metadata that will be automatically parsed and used to generate the blog post structure.\n\n## Features of the New System\n\n### Build-Time Processing\n- Markdown files are processed during AWS Amplify's build phase\n- No runtime parsing overhead\n- Optimized performance for users\n\n### Automatic Fallbacks\n- Files without frontmatter are still supported\n- Automatic title extraction from H1 headers\n- Smart excerpt generation from content\n- Read time calculation based on word count\n\n### Enhanced Metadata\nThe system automatically handles:\n- **Title extraction** from frontmatter or H1 headers\n- **Excerpt generation** from frontmatter or content\n- **Tag inference** from content analysis\n- **Read time calculation** based on standard reading speed\n- **Date handling** from frontmatter or file modification time\n\n## Code Example\n\nHere's how the build script processes markdown files:\n\n```javascript\nconst matter = require('gray-matter');\nconst parsed = matter(content);\n\nif (parsed.data && Object.keys(parsed.data).length > 0) {\n  // Use frontmatter data\n  blogPost = {\n    title: parsed.data.title,\n    excerpt: parsed.data.excerpt,\n    // ... other fields\n  };\n} else {\n  // Fallback extraction\n  blogPost = {\n    title: extractTitle(content, filename),\n    excerpt: generateExcerpt(content),\n    // ... other fields\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Integration with AWS Amplify\n\nThe system integrates seamlessly with AWS Amplify through the `amplify.yml` configuration:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 1\nfrontend:\n  phases:\n    preBuild:\n      commands:\n        - npm ci\n        - node build-markdown.js\n    build:\n      commands:\n        - npm run build\n```\n\nThis ensures that your markdown files are processed before the main build, creating an optimized static site with dynamic content sourcing.\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Performance**: No runtime markdown parsing\n2. **Flexibility**: Supports files with or without frontmatter\n3. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new blog posts\n4. **Scalability**: Handles any number of markdown files\n5. **SEO-Friendly**: Pre-generated content for better indexing\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo implement this system in your own project:\n\n1. Add the build script and configuration files\n2. Create your markdown files in the `/blogs` directory\n3. Deploy to AWS Amplify\n4. Watch as your site automatically rebuilds with new content!\n\nHappy blogging! 🚀\n",
